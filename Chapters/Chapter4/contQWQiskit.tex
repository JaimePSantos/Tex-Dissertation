As was seen in section \ref{sec:chap3Contwalk}, the unitary evolution operator of this model is defined as
\begin{equation}
        U(t) = e^{-iHt} = e^{i(-\gamma L)t} = e^{-i\gamma(A+D)t}.
\end{equation}
Considering a regular graph, this operator can be rewritten as 
\begin{equation}
	U(t) = \phi(t) e^{-i\gamma(A)t},
\end{equation}
where $\phi(t)$ is a global phase and $A$ is the adjacency matrix associated with the graph.\par
Here, the study will focus on the circuit implementation of this walk in a cyclic graph, and a different approach was used to define the adjacency matrix. This approach relies on the concept of a circulant graph, which are a class of graphs defined by a circulanti matrix such that
\begin{equation}
A = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		c_0&c_{N-1}& \cdots&c_3&c_2 \\
		c_1&c_0& c_{N-1}& &c_{3} \\
		\vdots & c_1 & c_0 &\ddots & \vdots\\
		c_{N-2}& & \ddots&\ddots &c_{N-1}\\
		c_{N-1} & c_{N-2} & \cdots & c_1 & c_0\\
	\end{pmatrix}.
\label{eq:adjCirculant}
\end{equation}
In order to generate the proper circulant graphs, restrictions on this matrix are needed. Firstly, $c_0=0$, since self-loops are not part of the structure. Secondly, the matrix must be symmetric, therefore $c_{n-j} = c_j$.\par
These matrices can be fully described by the first column of the matrix 
\begin{equation}
	v_1 = [c_{0},c_{1}, \cdots, c_{N-2}, c_{N-1}]^T 
\end{equation}
with a discrete convolution operator performing cyclic permutations of $c$, on each column. For example,
\begin{equation}
	D v_1 = [c_{N-1}, c_{0}, \cdots, c_{N-3}, c_{N-2}]^T = v_2.
\end{equation}
More specifically, for the cycle case
\begin{equation}
	D v_1 = D [0, 1 ,0 , \cdots, 0, 1]^T =[1, 0, 1, 0, \cdots, 0, 0]^T = v_2.
\end{equation}
%TODO: Estas definicoes estao mal. 
The operator can then be recursively defined as
\begin{equation}
    Dv_k = v_{k+1}.
\end{equation}
and the matrix will be
\begin{equation}
	A = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} D v_j 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	A^k = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} c_{(j-1)\mod{N}}
\end{equation}\par
The eigenvalues of a circulant matrix can be found by
\begin{equation}
\lambda_p = c_0 + \sum_{q=1} c_{N-q} \omega^{pq},
\end{equation}
and the eigenvectors are 
\begin{equation}
\ket{\varphi_p} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{q=0}^{n-1} \omega^{pq}.
\end{equation}
This given, it is possible to construct an operator that diagonalizes the circulant matrix through the eigenvectors, which is useful for constructing the circuit. For this purpous, the Quantum Fourier Transform can be used and it is defined as 
\begin{equation}
F = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{p,q} \omega^{pq} \ket{p}\bra{q}.
\end{equation}
The adjacency matrix of a circulant graph can then be diagonalized such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diag_adj}
    A = F^{\dagger} \Lambda F,
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is a diagonal operator that encodes the eigenvalues
\begin{equation}
\Lambda = \sum_{j} \lambda_j \ket{j}\bra{j}.
\end{equation}\par
%TODO: Mostrar o raciocinio da algebra.
The unitary operator of the walk can then be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uqft}
    U = F^{\dagger}e^{i\gamma \Lambda t} F
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    e^{i\gamma \Lambda t} = \sum_{j} e^{i\gamma \lambda_j t} \ket{j}\bra{j}.
\end{equation}\par
%TODO: Explicar a diagonal()?
The circuit can now be constructed making use of the \textit{diagonal} function provided by Qiskit, which decomposes diagonal operators based on the method presented in theorem 7 of \cite{Shende06}. The other tool used was the Quantum Fourier Transform, also provided by the Qiskit package. Figure
