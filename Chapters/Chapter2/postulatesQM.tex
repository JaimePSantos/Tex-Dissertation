Quantum mechanics, firstly discovered in the decade of 1920, is a mathematical
framework for developing physical theories. In this section, the goal is to
provide the basic postulates of quantum mechanics, which are formalized through
Dirac notation. Further reading on this notation includes the work of
\cite{sakurai1994}, and for an extensive review of quantum computation the
book by \cite{nielsen2011}.\par  
The first postulate defines where the processes of quantum mechanics take
place. The \textit{state} of a system describes it's physical characteristics,
so some rules are required for these mathematical objects to have a connection
to the real world.
\begin{post}[State Space] 
	Any isolated physical system has an associated Hilbert Space,
	$\mathcal{H}$, known as the state space. The state of the system is
	wholly described by it's state vector $\ket{\psi} \in \mathcal{H}$. The
	physical system's degrees of freedom dictate the dimension of
	$\mathcal{H}$
\end{post}
Note that this postulate does not tell us the Hilbert space of any given
physical system, nor does it tell us it's state vector. It is generally hard to
define the Hilbert space of an arbitrary system, which makes the work physicist
have done developing certain theories, like quantum eletrodynamics, even more
remarkable.\par 
Considering the computational basis $\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$, the simplest quantum
system, the \textit{qubit}, can be defined as 
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha,\beta$ are complex numbers and
\begin{equation}
	\ket{0} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\0 \end{pmatrix}  \; \; ;  \;  \;  \ket{1} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\1 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Because Hilbert spaces are also vector spaces, linear combinations of these
states are also allowed 
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi} = \sum_i \alpha_i \ket{\varphi_i}.
\end{equation}
Since $\ket{\psi}$ is required to be a unit vector, $\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}=1$ or, equivalently,
\begin{equation}
	\sum_j | \alpha_j |^2 = 1 .
\end{equation}
These combinations are the main difference between a classical bit and a qubit,
known as \textit{superpositions}, in which the states are not in a definite
value before measurement. This is a well studied quantum phenomenon that leads
to constructive and destructive interference between states, which is an aspect
of quantum computation many algorithms exploit.\par
The second postulate aims to describe how a quantum system evolves with time,
and it can be formulated in the following way.
