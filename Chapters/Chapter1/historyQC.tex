The modern understanding of computer science was firstly announced by \cite{turing1936} where he developed the abstract concept of what is now called a \textit{Turing machine}. These machines are the mathematical foundation of programmable computers, and Turing showed that there is a \textit{Universal Turing Machine} that can be used to simulate any other Turing Machine. This means that if an algorithm can be executed in any piece of hardware, then there is a Universal Turing Machine that can acompish the same task. This is known as the \textit{Church-Turing thesis}
